Problems encountered
--------------------
To be honest JS course was difficult for me, even asking for help because I didn't even know how to tell my problem.
With several help from forums, friends and colleagues, I overcame some difficulties but I still have many things to learn.

1* I had too many issues to put canvas into my game, I put images from another version of the game.

2* Some parts of the code must be improved later for more options in hte game.

3* As I said my majopr problem was handling JS so it's really difficult to tell what comes from that or from "real" dev related problems.

4* I am not able to reproduce all of the stuff for later, is it normal to go check doc many times?
