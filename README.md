Problems encountered
--------------------
To be honest JS course was difficult for me, even asking for help because I didn't even know how to tell my problem.
With several help from forums, friends and colleagues, I overcame some difficulties but I still have many things to learn.

1* I had too many issues to put canvas into my game, I put images from another version of the game.
